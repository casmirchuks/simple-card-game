# simple-card-game

We've created a simple multiplayer card game where:

• 5 players are dealt 5 cards from two 52 card decks, and the winner is the one with the highest score.
The score for each player is calculated by adding up all 5 card values for each player, where the number
cards have their face value, J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13 and A = 11 (not 1).
•
In the event of a tie, the scores are recalculated for only the tied players by calculating a "suit score" for
each player to see if the tie can be broken (it may not).
Each card is given a score based on its suit, with clubs = 1, diamonds = 2, hearts = 3 and spades
= 4, and the player's score is the product (multiplication) of all 5 suit value.
